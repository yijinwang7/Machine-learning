# Machine-learning
In project 1, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree algorithms and bunches of sub-methods in algorithms are applied to analyse the ”Breast Cancer in Wisconsin” and ”Hepatitis” datasets. 

In project 2, Naive Bayes together with k-fold cross-validation and logistic regression are applied to analyze 20 news group and IMDB Reviews datasets.

In project 3, I used the Multilayer Perceptron to do the classification of image data on the MNIST dataset which is a collection of hand written numbers from 9 to 0. 

In the reproducing project 4, I did experiments on the audio classifications by the method called “ImageNet-Pretrained standard deep CNN model” which is generally used to do the ImageNet classifications.

All datasets are cleaned, merged and analysed before all the machine learning experiments.
