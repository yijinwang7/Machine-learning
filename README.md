# Machine-learning
In project 1, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree algorithms and bunches of sub-methods in algorithms are applied to analyse the ”Breast Cancer in Wisconsin” and ”Hepatitis” datasets. These two datasets are cleaned, merged and analysed before all the machine learning experiments.
