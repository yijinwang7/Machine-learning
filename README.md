# Machine-learning
In project 1, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree algorithms and bunches of sub-methods in algorithms are applied to analyse the ”Breast Cancer in Wisconsin” and ”Hepatitis” datasets. These two datasets are cleaned, merged and analysed before all the machine learning experiments. 

In project 2, Naive Bayes together with k-fold cross-validation and logistic regression are applied to analyze 20 news group and IMDB Reviews datasets.

In project 3, I used the Multilayer Perceptron to do the classification of image data on the MNIST dataset which is a collection of hand written numbers from 9 to 0.
